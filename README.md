# Memory Game Project

This project was developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. 
It is a game that randomly shuffles cardâ€™s symbols, and the game is over once all the pairs are matched.

The game progress is tracked in the score panel by looking at the numbers of stars you have, the number of moves, and the timer.

## Game Instructions

* Test the game: https://javiroser.github.io/Memory-Game/
* The game board has sixteen cards that are arranged randomly in a grid.
* To start playing, click on the tiles to turn them over and see the hidden symbol.
* Once the first card is clicked, the timer starts.
* Try to match all the pairs using as minimun turns as possible.
* If two cards match, they stay flipped over. 
* Otherwise, they show a shaking animation and they flip over.
* Keep track of the game by looking at the timer and star rating. 
  The rating drops one star if you take more than 26 moves, 
  and two stars if there are more than 48 moves.
* Once all the cards have been matched a congratulations popup appears showing your results. 
  The time it took the player to win and the star rating.
